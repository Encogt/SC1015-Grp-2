## Problem Definition
- Will we be able to predict an estimated price of a used car in Singapore based on the different variables measured?
- Which model will be the best to do so?
  
## Models Used
- Multi-Variate Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regression

## Conclusion
- Lasso Regression prodcued results very similar to Muti-Varient Linear Regression
- Removing outliers improved MSE significantly
- With enough variabled you are able to get a rough estimate of Car resale price
- Random forest Regressor is our best Model among the five done

## What have we learnt from this project?
- Multi-Variate Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressiono
- Using the model to implement usage
- Collaborating using GitHub
